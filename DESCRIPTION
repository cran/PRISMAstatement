Description: Plot a PRISMA <http://prisma-statement.org/> flow
    chart describing the identification, screening, eligibility and
    inclusion or studies in systematic reviews. The PRISMA statement
    defines an evidence-based, minimal set of items for reporting in
    systematic reviews and meta-analyses. PRISMA should be used for the
    reporting of studies evaluating randomized clinical trials (RCT), and
    is also for reporting on systematic reviews of other types of
    research. There is also a function to generate flow charts describing
    exclusions and inclusions for any kind of study.
